**Shape file 1: Pf1_Qonly.zip: Pf1-XXXtYYY-ZZZZhWWWW** is a pulse shape with duration XXX.YYYY times 1/fQ with fQ = 205 Hz; ZZZZ.WWWW is the peak amplitude in kHz.
**Shape file 2: Pf1_QuadRelax.zip Pf1-tXXXX-hYYYY** is a pulse with duration XX times 0.1/fQ with fQ = 205 Hz; YYYY Hz is the peak amplitude.

The shape files are in Bruker shape format, but since this is in ASCII it's easy to import into other programs. They are listed as relative amplitude between 0 and 100 and phase in degrees.
